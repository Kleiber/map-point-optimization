PLY is a file format for exchanging 3D data like meshes and 3D
scans.  This archive contains two MATLAB M-file functions to
read and write 3D data PLY files, "plyread.m" and "plywrite.m".
For details on the PLY format and links to PLY resources, see
the included "ply.htm" HTML file.  A sample PLY file, "cow.ply",
is included to demonstrate the "plyread.m" function.


New in 7/18/2004 release

- Bug fix in plyread.m

- Added plywritetri.m to easily write PLY files from
  triangular mesh data
