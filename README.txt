# Map Point Optimization in Keyframe-Based SLAM using Covisibility Graph and Information Fusion

Keyframe-based monocular SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is one of the main visual SLAM approaches, used to estimate the camera motion together with the map reconstruction over selected frames. These techniques based on keyframes represent the environment by map points located in the three-dimensional space that can be recognized and located in the frames. However, many of these techniques cannot combine map points corresponding to the same three-dimensional point or detect when a map point becomes outlier and an obsolete information. In this work, we present a robust method to maintain a refined map that uses the covisibility graph and an algorithm based on information fusion to build a probabilistic map, which explicitly models outlier measurements. In addition, we incorporate a pruning mechanism to reduce redundant information and remove outliers. In this way our approach manages the map size maintaining essential information of the environment. Finally, in order to evaluate the performance of our method, we incorporate it into an ORB-SLAM system and measure the accuracy achieved on publicly available benchmark datasets which contain indoor images sequences recorded with a hand-held monocular camera.
