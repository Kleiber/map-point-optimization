# map-point-optimization-in-keyframe-based-slam-using-covisibility-graph-and-information-fusion
Visual SLAM is a technology able to build a map of an unknown environment and perform location, simultaneously leveraging the partially built map, using just computer vision. In this work, we present a robust method to maintain a refined map that uses a covisibility graph and an algorithm based on information fusion to build a probabilistic map, which explicitly models outlier measurements.
